Let U be the Unlabelled data pool or stream
Randomly select k examples from U
    and query the oracle to initialize training set T 
increment cost by k

while cost < budget or U is empty do 
    train the model(s) using T
    select k examples from Unlabelled set based upon querying strategy 
    move these k examples into T
    remove these k examples from U
    increment cost by k


Let U be the Unlabelled data Pool
Randomly select k examples from U
and query the oracle to initialize training set T 
Add k to cost

while cost < budget or U is empty do 
    train the model using T
    for e in P compute uncertainty for e 
    select k examples from P with largest uncertainty
    move these k examples into T
    remove these k examples from U
    increment cost by k

Let U be the Unlabelled data Pool
Randomly select k examples from U
and query the oracle to initialize training set T 
Add k to cost
initialize a committee C of different models

while cost < budget or U is empty do 
    train each model using T
    for e in P use C to compute ranking
    select k examples from P with highest ranking
    move these k examples into T
    remove these k examples from U
    increment cost by k

Let U be the Unlabelled data stream 
observe the first k points from S 
and query the oracle to initialize training set T 
Add k to cost 

while cost < budget or U is empty do 

    train the model using T 
    while no points queried
        observe the next k points from S 
        for each observed point decide whether to query or discard 
            if queried add to T and add one to cost
